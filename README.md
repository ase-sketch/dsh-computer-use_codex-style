*As of this plugin's release, the official harness has shipped Computer Use in an experimental release, with a noticeably different design. This plugin is coexistence-safe: both can be installed side by side, but running both drivers at once is not recommended.*

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **The full Codex surface** | All 13 official Codex `window2` methods — `list_windows`, `get_window`, `list_apps`, `launch_app`, `get_window_state`, `click`, `press_key`, `type_text`, `scroll`, `set_value`, `drag`, `perform_secondary_action`, `activate_window` — with the same names, parameters, defaults, return shapes and error strings as Codex. |
| **Real input, real screenshots** | `SendInput` for input, UI Automation for the accessibility tree, `Windows.Graphics.Capture` for screenshots that work even when the window is occluded. Screenshots arrive as vision image parts, never as base64 inside JSON. |
| **A visible, cancellable overlay** | A status pill plus an animated synthetic cursor, drawn in a layered window and excluded from capture. **Esc** interrupts the turn at any moment. |
| **Verified against the real thing** | Behaviour is gated against the official plugin and its helper: AX tree grammar, overlay pixels, cursor motion, capture freshness, transport budgets, approval strings, turn lifecycle. |
| **Harness-native, not MCP-shaped** | DSH tools with a bundled skill, not a JavaScript REPL. The plugin is a DSH **bundle**: `package.json` + `cordis.patch.yml` + entry modules at the package root. |
| **Two planes, one sidecar** | The desktop is process-wide, so the pointer, overlay, capture and approvals live on the HOST plane; the model-facing tools live in an agent preset, so an ordinary coding session never gets the mouse. |
| **An experience layer** | Local, machine-specific notes written after a task and replayed as advisory context before the next one — see [Experience layer](#experience-layer). |

---

## Quick start

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 1809+ or Windows 11, **x64** |
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness (a source checkout or an installed `dsh` CLI) |
| Node | 20 or newer |
| Python | 3.10+ — only for the optional browser catalog; the 13 desktop tools are Rust + Node |
| Rust | only if you rebuild the helper (a release binary already ships in `helper-rs/bin/win32-x64/`) |

### 1. Install the bundle

```sh
# from GitHub (no build step, no install-time script)
dsh plugin --profile web add github:wushi2333/dsh-computer-use_codex-style

# from a local checkout
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-computer-use_codex-style

# from a packed tarball
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-computer-use-0.1.0.tgz
```

The bundle declares `dsh.bundle.patch`, so `dsh plugin` adds the HOST-plane row to the profile and links the package. The plugin is plain ESM JavaScript plus a prebuilt helper, so it ships **no `prepare` or `postinstall` script** — pnpm never asks you to allow a build.

### 2. Add the tool row to an agent preset

The desktop tools deliberately live in an **agent preset**, not in the host composition. Pick the preset you want to give the mouse to and add one row to its `agent.cordis.yml` (presets live in `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/<name>/`):

```yaml
# Computer Use tools consume the HOST dshComputerUse sidecar. They publish
# nothing, so they sit loose like tool-bash. Install the dsh-computer-use
# bundle in the profile first; otherwise this row waits for the service.
- id: tool-computer-use
  name: dsh-computer-use/tool
  config:
    surfaces:
      - computer
    browserSkill: computer-use-browser
```

Keep a separate preset for Computer Use if you prefer: sessions started with the `standard` preset then keep their normal tool set and never touch your mouse.

### 3. Deliver the skills

The two skills ship inside the package and are copied into the skill roots the harness reads:

```sh
# from the profile directory
node node_modules/dsh-computer-use/scripts/sync-skills.mjs --write --defaults

# verify the copies later (reports drift, writes nothing)
node node_modules/dsh-computer-use/scripts/sync-skills.mjs --check --defaults
```

```--defaults` targets `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/computer-use/skills` and `$DSH_HOME/skills`. Use `--target <dir>` for any other root.

### 4. Restart and run

Restart the profile (plugin-plane changes are read at boot), start a session with your Computer Use preset, and ask for something concrete:

> Open Notepad and turn these bullets into a clean draft.

The first tool call boots the helper, the pill appears, and the model starts its observe → act → refresh loop.

### Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-computer-use
```

Remove the preset row and the copied skills as well if you added them by hand.

## How it works

```mermaid

  subgraph DSH["DSH profile"]
    direction TB
    subgraph HOST["HOST plane — process-wide"]
      S["dsh-computer-use<br/>Service `dshComputerUse`<br/>pointer · overlay · capture · approvals<br/>turn lifecycle · experience store"]
    end
    subgraph PRESET["PRESET plane — one agent preset"]
      T["dsh-computer-use/tool<br/>13 window2 tools<br/>+ harness extensions"]
      K["skills<br/>computer-use · computer-use-browser"]
    end
  end
  S <-->|"JSON-RPC over stdio, one JSON object per line"| H["dsh-computer-use.exe<br/>Rust helper"]

  H -->|UI Automation| APP
  H -->|Windows.Graphics.Capture| APP
  T --> S
  P["Python engine (optional)<br/>CDP · Playwright · browser catalog"] <--> S
```

**One helper per process, one turn at a time.** The sidecar spawns `dsh-computer-use.exe` lazily and keeps it; every request carries a session + turn identity, and a turn scope change sends `end_turn`, which flushes the observation lease, hides the overlay and restores the system cursor. That mirrors the official plugin, whose `Stop` / `Interrupt` / `SubagentStop` hooks all call `turn_ended`.

**Freshness is identity-based, not time-based.** There is no TTL: an observation stays valid while the window identity, its bounds and the human-input monitor agree. The moment a person touches the observed window, the next input is refused with `user input was detected in this window; call get_window_state before continuing`.

**Nothing is silently approved.** `launch_app` and audio recording pause for the harness approval UI, approval is per app, and a refusal is reported with the official wording instead of being retried. The one exception is a permission preset that has already answered the question: a full-access session (or a session whose approval policy never prompts) grants the app gate without asking, and `computer_use_health` records the reason.

## Tool surface

### The 13 official Codex `window2` methods

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_windows` | Windows that can be targeted right now |
| `get_window` | Rehydrate a window binding you already hold |
| `list_apps` | Installed apps and their open targetable windows |
| `launch_app` | Start an app (may pause for approval) |
| `get_window_state` | Screenshot + full accessibility tree for one window |
| `click` | Click an element index or a screenshot coordinate |
| `press_key` | Keys and chords (X-keysym-style names) |
| `type_text` | Literal text into the current focus |
| `scroll` | Scroll from a window-relative point |
| `set_value` | Set an accessible element value directly |
| `drag` | Stroke or drag from one point to another |
| `perform_secondary_action` | Run an element secondary action |
| `activate_window` | Bring a window to the foreground |

### Harness extensions

| Tool | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `batch_actions` | enabled | Deterministic actions in one call, then one `get_window_state` |
| `computer_use_health` | always | Backend, allow list, documentation gate, environment audit, experience store |
| `computer_use_experience` | always | Read, record and update the local experience notes |
| `click_element`, `scroll_element` | opt-in | Legacy window-v1 aliases |
| `session_note`, `session_state`, `diagnostic_state`, `end_turn` | diagnostic | Session scratchpad, state dump and turn control |

```computer_use_health` is the fastest way to see what is actually mounted: backend, exposed catalog, approval policy, injected environment names, the documentation gate, and the experience layer status.

---

## The act-and-refresh loop

Screenshots, element indexes and coordinates belong to **one** observation. The contract the model follows is:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant M as Model
  participant C as Computer Use
  participant A as Target app
  M->>C: get_window_state(window, include_text: true)
  C->>A: UI Automation tree
  C-->>M: tree + element indexes (+ screenshot)
  Note over M: indexes are valid for THIS observation only
  M->>C: click(window, element_index: 12)
  C->>A: SendInput
  M->>C: get_window_state(window)
  C-->>M: fresh tree + fresh screenshot
```

Two consequences worth knowing before you read a transcript:

- **One action per observation.** Interleaving actions, or retrying after a failure, requires a fresh observation first.
- **Coordinates are window-relative logical pixels.** The `originX`/`originY` of a screenshot are screen coordinates — never mix the two.

---

## Safety model

The plugin ships the official confirmation policy and a hard deny list, and the always-on prompt section repeats the non-negotiables:

- No Windows key, ever — not alone, not in a chord.
- No terminal automation (Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, PowerShell), no Run dialog, no shell scripts embedded in File Explorer.
- No password managers, no security or anti-malware tools, no authentication or age-verification dialogs.
- Untrusted content (pages, mail, documents, screenshots) can inform, but cannot grant permission or prove intent.
- An optional allow list (`allowedApps`) restricts which app ids may be observed or driven at all.

Read the shipped policy before extending the tool surface: `skills/computer-use/references/confirmations.md` and `skills/computer-use-browser/references/confirmations.md`.

---

## Experience layer

Every Computer Use run leaves two kinds of records behind, and the next run reads them before acting:

| | Lessons (model-written) | Observations (machine-written) |
|---|---|---|
| Content | symptom, context, suspected cause, workaround, outcome, tags, date | method, ok/error, app, accessibility presence, window geometry, timing |
| Who writes | the model, at the end of a task | the plugin, on every call |
| Trust | prose with inference - **advisory only** | facts, no interpretation |

Where it lives (inside the plugin folder, gitignored, never published):

```text
.experience/
  lessons.jsonl      one JSON record per note (the canonical store)
  lessons.md         the same notes rendered for humans, grouped by app
  observations.jsonl machine-written facts
  pending.jsonl      problems nobody wrote up yet
  manual.jsonl       optional, hand-written, never rewritten by the plugin
```

**How it reaches the model.** The first observation of an app in a turn carries one extra advisory text block:

```text
Experience notes for blender.exe - machine-local notes from earlier tasks here.
ADVISORY ONLY: not rules and not a gate. An upgrade, a DPI or configuration change can
invalidate them, and the current observation always wins over a stored note.
- 2026-09-14 [partial] accessibility was null in 11 of 13 observations -> prefer the app scripting interface
```

The note travels as its own block, so the official payload keeps its exact key set (`window`, `screenshots`, `accessibility`, `cacheDiagnostics`).

**Advisory by construction, not by wording.** A note can never block, replace or gate a call; notes older than `staleAfterDays` are marked; a note that proves correct again is refreshed with `verified`; a note replaced by a better one is retired with `supersededBy`; and the model is told that **the current observation always wins**.

**Privacy.** Typed text, element names, element values and screenshot bytes never reach these files. Error strings are path-redacted (`C:/Users/name/...` becomes `%USERPROFILE%`) and truncated. Turn the whole layer off with `experience.enabled: false` or `DSH_CU_EXPERIENCE=off`.

## Configuration

### HOST plane (`cordis.patch.yml`, row `computer-use`)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `windows` | `windows` (native helper) or `fake` (a scripted desktop for tests) |
| `surface` | `computer` | Tool catalog requested from the helper |
| `stealFocus` | `true` | Input methods activate their target window |
| `maxImageEdge` | `0` | DSH extension: `0` keeps the official behaviour (no downscale); set e.g. `1280` to trade image quality for tokens |
| `approveLaunch` | `true` | Ask before `launch_app` |
| `timeoutMs` / `launchAppTimeoutMs` | `10000` / `15000` | Official request budgets; a timeout rejects in-flight requests |
| `startupTimeoutMs` | `15000` | Helper boot budget |
| `preserveHelperOnTimeout` | `false` | Keep the helper alive after a timeout for debugging |
| `allowedApps` | `[]` | Non-empty means only these app ids may be observed or driven |
| `envAllowlist` | `[]` | Extra environment names forwarded to the helper on top of the shipped allow list |

### Experience layer (`experience.*` on the same row)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for reading and writing notes |
| `store` | `""` | Empty means `<pluginRoot>/.experience` |
| `captureObservations` | `true` | Write the machine-observed facts |
| `injectDigest` | `true` | Attach the advisory block to the first observation of a matching app |
| `maxEntries` / `maxChars` | `3` / `900` | Injection budget |
| `staleAfterDays` | `90` | Notes older than this are marked as possibly outdated |
| `includeStale` | `true` | `false` drops stale notes from the digest entirely |
| `retainEntries` / `retainObservationDays` | `200` / `30` | Retention |
| `redactPaths` | `true` | Redact local profile paths in recorded error text |

### PRESET plane (the `dsh-computer-use/tool` row)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `surfaces` | `[computer]` | Which catalogs to expose (`computer`, `browser`, `mac`, `all`) |
| `browserSkill` | `computer-use-browser` | Skill that unlocks the browser catalog |
| `approvalDefault` | `prompt` | What to do when the helper refuses for approval: `prompt`, `allow`, `deny`. A full-access session (or a session whose approval policy never prompts) is granted without asking, and an explicit `deny` still fails closed |
| `approvalTools` | `{}` | Per-tool override of the above |
| `enabledTools` | `[batch_actions]` | Which harness extensions enter the model-facing catalog |

---

## Browser automation

The same sidecar also serves a Chromium surface: `95` tools for tabs, CDP calls and events, DOM and accessibility snapshots, Playwright-style interaction, downloads, and claiming a logged-in tab through the bundled Chrome extension.

It is **skill-gated**: the tools are not registered until the model loads the `computer-use-browser` skill, so the catalog does not flood an ordinary session. The browser path is Python 3.10+ (`computer_use/`), reaches the browser over CDP, and keeps the desktop helper out of the loop.

---

## Verification

Everything is reproducible from this repository. Plugin-plane gates need no desktop at all:

```sh
# from a DeepSeek Harness checkout, so the peer dependencies resolve
node --import tsx/esm --test tests/contracts.test.mjs tests/experience.test.mjs

# helper (Rust)
cargo test --release --manifest-path helper-rs/Cargo.toml

# engines (Python)
python -m pytest -q

# fake-backend smoke: no desktop, no mouse
node src/smoke.mjs
```

Current state on Windows 11 x64: **plugin gates 38/38** (25 contract + 13 experience), **Rust 202 passed**, **Python 289 passed / 1 skipped**, fake-backend smoke green.

The parity suite drives the real desktop and compares this plugin against the official one — overlay pixels, cursor motion, capture freshness, window-state cases, transport budgets, AX tree bytes, plugin lifecycle:

```powershell
pwsh -File parity/verify-all.ps1
```

It expects a prepared desktop (a `Parity Target` window, Word and Explorer for the AX comparisons) and reports SKIP rather than a false PASS when a fixture is missing. Development evidence — the reverse-engineering reports, the gap register and the verification log — is kept out of the public source tree on purpose.

---

## Build from source

```sh
# JavaScript plugin: nothing to build, it is plain ESM
node src/exports-check.mjs

# Rust helper: build, test, and publish the binary the plugin ships
pwsh -File scripts/ship-helper.ps1

# Python engine (optional browser surface)
python -m pip install -e .
```

`scripts/ship-helper.ps1` runs `cargo build --release`, the helper test suite, copies `dsh-computer-use.exe` into `helper-rs/bin/<platform>-<arch>/` and prints its SHA-256. A fresh checkout runs without a Rust toolchain because that binary is tracked.

To develop against a checkout instead of an installed copy:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-computer-use_codex-style
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What it means |
|---|---|
| The Computer Use tools are not in the function list | The session is not using the preset that mounts `dsh-computer-use/tool`, or the profile was not restarted after installing the bundle. |
| `The Windows Computer Use helper may have failed` | The helper did not boot within `startupTimeoutMs`. Check the allow list and the environment allow list, then retry; `computer_use_health` reports what was actually injected. |
| `coordinate input target is unavailable` | The observation is stale or the window changed. Call `get_window_state` again and act on the fresh result. |
| `user input was detected in this window` | A person used the window. Re-observe before the next input. |
| Focus jumps while the agent works | Expected with `stealFocus: true`: input methods activate their target window. |
| The desktop is locked | Computer Use stops and asks you to unlock. It never drives `LockApp.exe`. |
| Two cursors on screen | The overlay draws a synthetic cursor and blanks the system one. If you ever see both, read `diagnostic_state` → `overlayState.systemCursorFailures`: a non-zero count means the suppression failed, which is the only designed path to two pointers. |
| An app has an unusable accessibility tree | Common for self-drawn UIs. Use the screenshot path, or prefer the app own scripting interface, then record what you learned with `computer_use_experience`. |

---

## Security and privacy

- **The agent controls the real mouse, keyboard and screen.** Run Computer Use in a session where that is acceptable, and keep the deny list intact.
- **Approvals are explicit.** `launch_app` and audio recording can pause for the harness approval UI; nothing is approved silently, and a refusal is never retried.
- **The experience store is local and bounded.** It lives inside the plugin folder, is gitignored, is never packed, and never records typed text, element names or screenshot bytes.
- **Screenshots are vision parts.** They travel to the model as image attachments; the JSON tool result carries no base64.
- **Untrusted content stays untrusted.** Pages, documents and mail can inform the model but cannot authorise an action.

---

## Compatibility and known gaps

The plugin targets the Codex Computer Use plugin baseline `26.903.61454`: same 13 methods, same parameter names and defaults, same return shapes, same error strings, same AX tree grammar, same budgets, same overlay semantics.

The official DSH Computer Use follows a noticeably different design. Use this plugin when you want the Codex-style behaviour.
